				<p>If I was about to make a website I would include alot of things. I like to game, but I get bored when I have mastered it. I took a Muay Thai class and now I am trying to go everyday. I don't know, but I think that I will major in Computer Science in college. CBU might be the college I go to.</p>
				<p>I like fast cars and driving them. I also like to learn many skills, even if they do not benefit me in life, they benefit my well-being and character.I also have an interest in typing. What I want to include is really cool animations that involves any of my interest. I like surprises, but not a disappointing one.</p>
